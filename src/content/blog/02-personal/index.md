I'm Chris Anderson, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, New York. I love learning languages - I speak Spanish, Portuguese and French and have lived in 4 different countries since I became an adult, including in Colombia for over 5 years. (Ask me about all the types of trees I planted there! Jackfruit, mango, jaboticaba, anything that could grow in the hot tropics.)

My spouse's family runs an educational non-profit in Casanare and has taught English and other core subjects to thousands of students in a remote town. For years, I have helped them with recruiting long-term volunteers, fundraising, and I taught English and computer programming classes in my free time while I was living there.
