I'm Chris Anderson, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, New York. I specialize in building scalable web applications and leading engineering teams to deliver high-quality software solutions. With almost a decade of experience in the tech industry, I have a strong foundation in backend development, cloud computing, automated testing, and Bubble.io.

In 2023 and 2024, I took on more responsibilities and transitioned into both a managerial role and got very involved in product planning. I lead a team of five engineers and collaborate with cross-functional teams to drive product development. I am passionate about mentoring junior developers and building inclusive, high-performing teams.

In 2025, I have been focused on up-skilling with AI and machine learning, including collaborating with professionals on using NLP and agent-based systems at Micromentor. I am excited about the future of AI and its potential to transform the way we build software, including the advance of coding tools that can help developers be more productive and innovative. (I am also sceptical of hype and know the very real limitations of these tools.)
